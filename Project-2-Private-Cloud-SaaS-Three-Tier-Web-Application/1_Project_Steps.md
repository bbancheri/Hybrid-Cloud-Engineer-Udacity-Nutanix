## Project Steps ##
In order to complete the project, you need to:
* Design a blueprint to deploy and configure a three-tier web application with a load balancer, web server, and database VM hosted on the private cloud.
* Insure each VM is configured with the proper resources and tasks.
* Test the deployment works with a read and write to the database.
* Test web tier scaling: scale-in and scale-out actions changing the population by a count of 1.
* Allow an end-user to make a database backup.
